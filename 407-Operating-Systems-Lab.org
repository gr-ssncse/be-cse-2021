** R2021 CHANGES :noexport:
No changes

#+begin_comment
 1. 2 Experiments removed
 2. Shell programming experiment removed.
 Deadlock detection is removed as deadlock avoidance is already there under deadlock concept. 
 3. Not Applicable
 4. Five course outcomes clearly defined and aligned with the experiments
 5. Lab requirements clearly outlined.
